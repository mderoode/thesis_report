abstract = {With continuously growing numbers of applications, enterprises face the problem of efficiently managing the assignment of access permissions to their users. On the one hand, security demands a tight regime on permissions; on the other hand, users need permissions to perform their tasks. Role-based access control (RBAC) has proven to be a solution to this problem but relies on a well-defined set of role definitions, a role concept for the enterprise in question. The definition of a role concept (role engineering) is a difficult task traditionally performed via interviews and workshops. However, often users already have the permissions that they need to do their jobs, and roles can be derived from these permission assignments using data mining technology, thus giving the process of role concept definition a head-start.In this paper, we present the ORCA role mining tool and its algorithm. The algorithm performs a cluster analysis on permission assignments to build a hierarchy of permission clusters and presents the results to the user in graphical form. It allows the user to interactively add expert knowledge to guide the clustering algorithm. The tool provides valuable insights into the permission structures of an enterprise and delivers an initial role hierarchy for the definition of an enterprise role concept using a bottom-up approach.},

This paper demonstrates that the discovered process models can be extended with information to predict the completion time of running instances. There are many scenarios where it is useful to have reliable time predictions. For example, when a customer phones her insurance company for information about her insurance claim, she can be given an estimate for the remaining processing time. In order to do this, we provide a configurable approach to construct a process model, augment this model with time information learned from earlier instances, and use this to predict e.g., the completion time. To provide meaningful time predictions we use a configurable set of abstractions that allow for a good balance between "overfitting" and "underfitting". The approach has been implemented in ProM and through several experiments using real-life event logs we demonstrate its applicability. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Workflow systems seek to provide an implementation vehicle for complex, recurring business processes. Notwithstanding this common objective, there are a variety of distinct features offered by commercial workflow management systems. These differences result in significant variations in the ability of distinct tools to represent and implement the plethora of requirements that may arise in contemporary business processes. Many of these requirements recur quite frequently during the requirements analysis activity for workflow systems and abstractions of these requirements serve as a useful means of identifying the key components of workflow languages. Previous work has identified a number of Workflow Control Patterns and Workflow Data Patterns, which characterize the range of control flow and data constructs that might be encountered when modelling and analysing workflows. In this paper, we describe a series of Workflow Resource Patterns that aim to capture the various ways in which resources are represented and utilized in workflows. By delineating these Patterns in a form that is independent of specific workflow technologies and modelling languages, we are able to provide a comprehensive treatment of the resource perspective and we subsequently use these Patterns as the basis for a detailed comparison of a number of commercially available workflow management systems and business process modelling languages.},

As modern organisations use information systems to automate their business processes and record information about processes' executions in event logs, it now becomes possible to get objective information about resource behaviours by analysing data recorded in event logs. We present an extensible framework for extracting knowledge from event logs about the behaviour of a human resource and for analysing the dynamics of this behaviour over time. The framework is fully automated and implements a predefined set of behavioural indicators for human resources. It also provides a means for organisations to define their own behavioural indicators, using the conventional Structured Query Language, and a means to analyse the dynamics of these indicators. The framework's applicability is demonstrated using an event log from a German bank. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

Conceptual models of such service processes enable operational analysis that supports, e.g., resource provisioning or delay prediction. Automatic mining of such operational models becomes feasible in the presence of event-data traces. In this work, we target the mining of models that assume a resource-driven perspective and focus on queueing effects. We propose a solution for the discovery and validation problem of scheduled service processes - processes with a predefined schedule for the execution of activities. Our prime example for such processes are complex outpatient treatments that follow prior appointments. Given a process schedule and data recorded during process execution, we show how to discover Fork/Join networks, a specific class of queueing networks, and how to assess their operational validity. We evaluate our approach with a real-world dataset comprising clinical pathways of outpatient clinics, recorded by a real-time location system (RTLS). We demonstrate the value of the approach by identifying and explaining operational bottlenecks. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.The performance of scheduled business processes is of central importance for services and manufacturing systems. However, current techniques for performance analysis do not take both queueing semantics and the process perspective into account. In this work, we address this gap by developing a novel method for utilizing rich process logs to analyze performance of scheduled processes. The proposed method combines simulation, queueing analytics, and statistical methods. At the heart of our approach is the discovery of an individual-case model from data, based on an extension of the Colored Petri Nets formalism. The resulting model can be simulated to answer performance queries, yet it is computational inefficient. To reduce the computational cost, the discovered model is projected into Queueing Networks, a formalism that enables efficient performance analytics. The projection is facilitated by a sequence of folding operations that alter the structure and dynamics of the Petri Net model. We evaluate the approach with a real-world dataset from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, a large outpatient cancer hospital in the United States.},

abstract = {Organizations maintain process models that describe or prescribe how cases (e.g., orders) are handled. However, reality may not agree with what is modeled. Conformance checking techniques reveal and diagnose differences between the behavior that is modeled and what is observed. Existing conformance checking approaches tend to focus on the control-flow in a process, while abstracting from data dependencies, resource assignments, and time constraints. Even in those situations when other perspectives are considered, the control-flow is aligned first, i.e., priority is given to this perspective. Data dependencies, resource assignments, and time constraints are only considered as “second-class citizens”, which may lead to misleading conformance diagnostics. For example, a data attribute may provide strong evidence that the wrong activity was executed. Existing techniques will still diagnose the data-flow as deviating, whereas our approach will indeed point out that the control-flow is deviating. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed that balances the deviations with respect to all these perspectives based on a customizable cost function. Evaluations using both synthetic and real data sets show that a multi-perspective approach is indeed feasible and may help to circumvent misleading results as generated by classical single-perspective or staged approaches.},

abstract = {Sentiment classification on product reviews has become a popular topic in the research community. In this paper, we propose an approach to generating multi-unigram features to enhance a negation-aware Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment classification on sentences of product reviews. We coin the term "multi-unigram feature" to represent a new kind of features that are generated in our proposed algorithm with capturing high-frequently co-appeared unigram features in the training data. We further make the classifier aware of negation expressions in the training and classification process to eliminate the confusions of the classifier that is caused by negation expressions within sentences. Extensive experiments on a human-labeled data set not only qualitatively demonstrate good quality of the generated multi-unigram features but also quantitatively show that our proposed approach beats three baseline methods. Experiments on impact analysis of parameters illustrate that our proposed approach stably outperforms the baseline methods. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Resource allocation is of great importance for business process management. In business process execution, a set of rules that specify resource allocation is always implied. Although many approaches have been offered to support resource allocation, they are not sufficient to derive interesting resource allocation rules which ensure that each activity is performed by suitable resource. Hence, this paper introduces an association rule mining based approach to mine interesting resource allocation rules from event log. The idea is to concern the ordered correlations between items in event log, and then to present two efficient algorithms to mine real "interesting" rules. The event log of radiology CT-scan examination process provided by the Chinese Huzhou hospital is used to verify the proposed approach. The evaluation results showed that the proposed approach not only is able to extract the rules more efficient and much faster, but also can discover more important resource allocation rules. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Information systems have been widely adopted to support service processes in various domains, e.g., in the telecommunication, finance, and health sectors. Information recorded by systems during the operation of these processes provides an angle for operational process analysis, commonly referred to as process mining. In this work, we establish a queueing perspective in process mining to address the online delay prediction problem, which refers to the time that the execution of an activity for a running instance of a service process is delayed due to queueing effects. We present predictors that treat queues as first-class citizens and either enhance existing regression-based techniques for process mining or are directly grounded in queueing theory. In particular, our predictors target multi-class service processes, in which requests are classified by a type that influences their processing. Further, we introduce queue mining techniques that derive the predictors from event logs recorded by an information system during process execution. Our evaluation based on large real-world datasets, from the telecommunications and financial sectors, shows that our techniques yield accurate online predictions of case delay and drastically improve over predictors neglecting the queueing perspective.},

abstract = {Currently, workflow technology is widely used to facilitate the business process in enterprise information systems (EIS), and it has the potential to reduce design time, enhance product quality and decrease product cost. However, significant limitations still exist: as an important task in the context of workflow, many present resource allocation (also known as "staff assignment") operations are still performed manually, which are time-consuming. This paper presents a data mining approach to address the resource allocation problem (RAP) and improve the productivity of workflow resource management. Specifically, an Apriori-like algorithm is used to find the frequent patterns from the event log, and association rules are generated according to predefined resource allocation constraints. Subsequently, a correlation measure named lift is utilized to annotate the negatively correlated resource allocation rules for resource reservation. Finally, the rules are ranked using the confidence measures as resource allocation rules. Comparative experiments are performed using C4.5, SVM, ID3, Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes and the presented approach, and the results show that the presented approach is effective in both accuracy and candidate resource recommendations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Our target stakeholders are the course designers who aim to evaluate their learning materials. In order to gain insight into the way educational resources are used, we view dropout behaviour in an atypical manner: Instead of using it as an indicator of failure, we use it as a mean to compute other features. For this purpose, we developed a prototype, called RUAF, that can be applied to the data format provided by FutureLearn. As a proof of concept, we perform a study by applying this tool to the interaction data of learners from four MOOCs. We also study the quality of our computations, by comparing them to existing process mining approaches. We present results that highlight patterns showing how learners use resources. We also show examples of practical conclusions a course designer may benefit from.},

abstract = {In most business processes, several activities need to be executed by human resources and cannot be fully automated. To evaluate resource performance and identify best practices as well as opportunities for im-provement, managers need objective information about resource behaviors. Companies often use information systems to support their processes, and these systems record information about process execution in event logs. We present a framework for analyzing and evaluating resource behavior through mining such event logs. The framework provides (1) a method for extracting descriptive information about resource skills, utilization, preferences, productivity, and collaboration patterns; (2) a method for analyzing relationships between different resource behaviors and outcomes; and (3) a method for evaluating the overall resource productivity, tracking its changes over time, and comparing it to the productivity of other resources. To demonstrate the applicability of our framework, we apply it to analyze employee behavior in an Australian company and evaluate its usefulness by a survey among industry managers.},

As a result, the field has seen an increased uptake in recent years as evidenced by success stories and increased tool support. However, despite this impact, current performance analysis capabilities remain somewhat limited in the context of information-poor event logs. For example, natural daily and weekly patterns are not considered but they are vital for understanding the performance of processes and resources. In this paper, a new framework for analysing event logs is defined. Our framework is based on the concept of event interval. The framework allows for a systematic approach to sophisticated performance-related analysis beyond the capabilities of existing log-based analysis techniques, even with information-poor event logs. The paper formalises a range of event interval types and then presents an implementation as well as an evaluation of the proposed approach.},
